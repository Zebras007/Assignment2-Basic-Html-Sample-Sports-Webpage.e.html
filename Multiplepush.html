Whether you are a casual spectator or an avid player, there is no denying that soccer is one of the greatest sports out there.
                    Soccer originated over 3000 years ago when it was first played by the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/geography/aztec-empire.html" target="_blank">Aztecs</a>. They called it Tchatali and played with a rock for a ball. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE, the first ball game, called Cuju, took place in China. They played with a leather ball filled with feathers. In ancient <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/10-sports-that-came-from-ancient-greece.html" target="_blank">Greece</a> and Rome, ball games were also played, however, not at the Panhellenic Games or in amphitheaters.

Today, millions of people enjoy watching soccer games and playing them on a regular basis.

                <p class="a5">This fast-paced, action-packed sport requires a lot of skill and precision but can be fun for both players and spectators.
                    The <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/where-did-hockey-originate.html" target="_blank">origins of hockey</a>date back to the 18th century in England. Over time, different variations of the sport developed as people played their own versions of the game. Some notable examples include field hockey (played on grass or turf fields), street hockey (played on asphalt or concrete), and roller hockey (played on roller skates). Ice hockey originated in <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-most-popular-sports-in-canada.html" target="_blank">Canada</a> and was quickly adopted around the world as the predominant form of this sport.

                    So how exactly is hockey played? Well, it can vary depending on the type of hockey. For instance, in field hockey players use curved sticks to hit a small ball into their opponent's goal. Ice hockey players do the same thing. They use sticks to hit a puck but play on an ice rink instead of a field and wear skates rather than cleats. Street and roller hockey are also fairly similar. Both involve hitting a puck with sticks and playing on surfaces like asphalt or cement rather than grass or turf.

                <p class="a5">Kabaddi is a contact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_sport" target="_blank">team sport</a>.Played between two teams of seven players, the objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of a court, touch out as many of their defenders as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders, and in a single breath. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.
