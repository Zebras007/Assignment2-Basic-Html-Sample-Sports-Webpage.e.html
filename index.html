Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends.[4] He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.[5]
                            Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked him to change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the cricket facilities were better than those at Sharma’s old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my cricket".[5] Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him from number eight to open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener.

                    <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/where-did-soccer-originate.html" target="_blank">Soccer</a> is one of the most popular sports in the world, with over 3.5 billion fans around the globe. Known as football in many parts of the world, this exciting sport has gained a huge following due to its thrilling gameplay and fast-paced action. Whether you are a casual spectator or an avid player, there is no denying that soccer is one of the greatest sports out there.
                    Soccer originated over 3000 years ago when it was first played by the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/geography/aztec-empire.html" target="_blank">Aztecs</a>. They called it Tchatali and played with a rock for a ball. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE, the first ball game, called Cuju, took place in China. They played with a leather ball filled with feathers. In ancient <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/10-sports-that-came-from-ancient-greece.html" target="_blank">Greece</a> and Rome, ball games were also played, however, not at the Panhellenic Games or in amphitheaters.

Over time, it evolved into its current form and became popular all over Europe before spreading to other <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/who-brought-soccer-to-brazil.html" target="_blank">parts of the world</a>. Today, millions of people enjoy watching soccer games and playing them on a regular basis.

So why is soccer so popular? There are many factors that contribute to its continued success, including its speed and unpredictable outcomes. This leads to exciting and tense games that keep fans on the edge of their seats. In addition, soccer is also a very social sport, with spectators gathering together in <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-largest-football-soccer-stadiums-in-the-world.html" target="_blank">stadiums</a> and bars to cheer on their favorite teams.

                <p class="a5">This fast-paced, action-packed sport requires a lot of skill and precision but can be fun for both players and spectators.
                    The <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/where-did-hockey-originate.html" target="_blank">origins of hockey</a>date back to the 18th century in England. Over time, different variations of the sport developed as people played their own versions of the game. Some notable examples include field hockey (played on grass or turf fields), street hockey (played on asphalt or concrete), and roller hockey (played on roller skates). Ice hockey originated in <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-most-popular-sports-in-canada.html" target="_blank">Canada</a> and was quickly adopted around the world as the predominant form of this sport.
                    So how exactly is hockey played? Well, it can vary depending on the type of hockey. For instance, in field hockey players use curved sticks to hit a small ball into their opponent's goal. Ice hockey players do the same thing. They use sticks to hit a puck but play on an ice rink instead of a field and wear skates rather than cleats. Street and roller hockey are also fairly similar. Both involve hitting a puck with sticks and playing on surfaces like asphalt or cement rather than grass or turf.
                    Despite its popularity across the globe, there are still some people who do not know much about this beloved sport.
